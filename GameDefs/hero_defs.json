He was bested in the assault on Ten-Towns by Bruenor who decided his punishment would be five years and a day of service.

At the end of his service, Drizzt Do'Urden to taught Wulfgar the ways of combat and Bruenor crafted a mighty warhammer, named Aegis-fang.

Strix is careful, suspicious, and paranoid. She assumes the worst in everyone and is always ready to run away or hide. She lacks basic manners and maintains poor personal hygiene, exemplified by the collection of filthy oddities she hoards within her robes. As a child, Strix witnessed a shadowy creature slaughter her friends at the bakery where she worked, but was spared for unknown reasons.

            "Bio": "Zorbu grew up in a small village on the slopes of the mountains south of Yartar. He lived a typical gnomish childhood: tinkering with mechanical toys, pulling pranks on unsuspecting neighbors, and exploring the woodlands covering the mountains in the company of a local dwarf ranger, Galor Rockshield. One night an army of drow and their minions descended upon the village in force. Galor saved Zorbu's life, but many others were killed, including Zorbu's parents. From that day forth, Zorbu trained under Galor as a ranger, vowing revenge upon the drow and any who claim allegiance to them. Cunning and imaginative, Zorbu makes use of his tinkering skills to wield an impossibly large crossbow called Thunderbolt.",
