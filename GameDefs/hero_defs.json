Strix is careful, suspicious, and paranoid. She assumes the worst in everyone and is always ready to run away or hide. She lacks basic manners and maintains poor personal hygiene, exemplified by the collection of filthy oddities she hoards within her robes. As a child, Strix witnessed a shadowy creature slaughter her friends at the bakery where she worked, but was spared for unknown reasons. Her survivor's guilt drives her to try and help those in need, no matter the personal cost.",

As a cleric of Kelemvor, she grew up in service to the dying and the dead and developed a cold detachment to anything outside of duties to her faith. Beneath that frosty exterior is a loyal and caring adventurer, but it's a side she rarely shows to anyone outside her closest friends.",
